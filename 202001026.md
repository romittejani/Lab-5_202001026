In this code there are total 10 errors in which we got 5 diffrent type of errors. <br/> Below I have explained those 5 diffrent types of errors.

### 1
Line 6: <br/>
  import sys <br/>
We improted sys library but we didn't used it in entire code so it is not necessery to import it.

### 2
Line 11: <br/>
import pyarrow as pa
<br/> We tried to import pyrrow library but somehow we are not able to import it.

### 3
Line 18: <br>
def load(
        ckpt_dir: str,
        tokenizer_path: str,
        max_seq_len: int,
        max_batch_size: int,
) <br/>
We declared a function with too many local variables which is bad practice for efficiet code.

### 4
Line 42: <br/>
    with open(Path(ckpt_dir) / "params.json", "r") as f:
<br> Here we should use brackets to diffeanciate words.

### 5
Line 83: <br/>

def main( <br/>
     &ensp;&ensp;   ckpt_dir: str, <br/>
      &ensp;&ensp;  tokenizer_path: str, <br/>
     &ensp;&ensp;   temperature: float = 0.8, <br/>
     &ensp;&ensp;   top_p: float = 0.95,  # use 0.95 or so for top_p sampler, and 0.0 for top_k sampler <br/>
     &ensp;&ensp;   top_k: int = 40, <br/>
     &ensp;&ensp;   repetition_penalty: float = (1.0 / 0.85),  # 1.0 to disable repetition_penalty <br/>
     &ensp;&ensp;   sampler: str = 'top_p',  # top_p or top_k <br/>
     &ensp;&ensp;   max_seq_len: int = 2048, <br/>
      &ensp;&ensp;  max_batch_size: int = 1, <br/>
): <br/>
Here while we are defining a function we have used too many arguments that makes code less efficient in terms of efficiecy.
